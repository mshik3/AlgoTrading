# Financial Data API Deep Dive & Migration Guide

## Executive Summary

**Problem**: Yahoo Finance has become unreliable for algorithmic trading due to aggressive rate limiting and inconsistent data quality.

**Solution**: Migrate to Alpaca Markets Data API for professional-grade, reliable data with generous free tier.

## Current State Analysis

### Yahoo Finance Issues

- ❌ **Rate Limiting**: Blocks after 3-5 requests
- ❌ **Data Quality**: Frequent "delisted" errors for major symbols (SPY, QQQ, VTI)
- ❌ **No Official API**: Web scraping is fragile and unsupported
- ❌ **No SLA**: No uptime guarantees
- ❌ **Inconsistent**: Different results on different requests
