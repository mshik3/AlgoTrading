## 🛠️ New Architecture

### **Core Libraries Integrated**

```
📦 Modern Trading System
├── 🎯 PFund Framework          # ML-ready algo trading
├── 🏛️ Cvxportfolio            # Stanford/BlackRock optimization
├── 📊 PyPortfolioOpt           # 5k+ stars community optimization
├── 🔬 Backtrader               # Used by banks for backtesting
├── 💰 Professional Rebalancer  # Tax-loss harvesting
├── 📈 RiskFolio-Lib           # Advanced risk management
└── 🧮 QuantLib                 # Mathematical finance
```

### **New Files Created**

python modern_trading_system.py
```

### **2. Explore Advanced Features**

```python
# Black-Litterman optimization with your views
views = {'AAPL': 0.15, 'TSLA': -0.05}
result = optimizer.black_litterman_optimization(views)

# Multi-period optimization with transaction costs
result = optimizer.optimize_multi_period(horizon=252, transaction_cost=0.001)

result = quick_backtest('golden_cross', ['SPY'], initial_cash=100000)
```

### **3. Switch to Live Trading (When Ready)**

```python
# PFund makes this incredibly simple:
engine = pf.BacktestEngine()   # ← Backtesting
engine = pf.TradeEngine()      # ← Live trading (just change this line!)
```
