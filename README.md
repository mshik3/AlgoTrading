# Algorithmic Trading System

This is a comprehensive algorithmic trading system designed for small accounts ($500-$1000) focusing on equity markets. The system follows a modular pipeline architecture to collect market data, implement diversified equity trading strategies, and execute trades with sophisticated risk management.

## Trading Strategies

The system implements four diversified equity strategies to reduce risk and maximize opportunities across different market conditions:

### 1. Mean Reversion Strategy (25% of Portfolio)

**Concept**: Identifies assets that have deviated significantly from their historical averages and bets on them returning to normal levels.

**Implementation**:

- Track stocks and ETFs that are 2+ standard deviations from their 50-day moving average
- Use RSI and Bollinger Bands for confirmation
- Place limit orders when assets are significantly oversold
- Set profit targets at 15-20% to offset tax impacts

**Asset Allocation**:

- 60% individual stocks (higher volatility creates more opportunities)
- 40% sector ETFs

### 2. Deep Value Strategy (25% of Portfolio)

**Concept**: Places limit orders significantly below market price and waits for volatility to fill them, similar to patient value investing.

**Implementation**:

- Identify quality assets with good fundamentals
- Place limit buy orders 20-25% below current market prices
- Set take-profit targets at 20%+ (preferably holding for >1 year)
- Accept that many orders will never fill

**Asset Allocation**:

- 60% individual quality stocks with higher volatility
- 40% sector ETFs for market-wide correction opportunities

### 3. ETF Rotation Strategy (25% of Portfolio)

**Concept**: Identifies the strongest sector ETFs and rotates capital to follow market trends.

**Implementation**:

- Track 5-10 sector ETFs (technology, finance, healthcare, etc.)
- Weekly: Rank them by 3-month performance metrics
- Buy top 1-2 performers, hold until they drop below a certain rank
- Review and potentially rotate positions monthly

**Asset Allocation**:

- 100% sector ETFs (this strategy is specifically designed for ETFs)

### 4. Golden Cross Strategy (25% of Portfolio)

**Concept**: A classic trend-following approach that buys when short-term momentum crosses above long-term trends.

**Implementation**:

- Buy when the 50-day moving average crosses above the 200-day moving average
- Sell when it crosses below
- Apply to both broad market ETFs and select large-cap stocks
- Typically generates just a few trades per year

**Asset Allocation**:

- 50% broad market ETFs (SPY, QQQ)
- 50% large-cap individual stocks

## Risk Management

### Position Sizing & Risk Controls

- Maximum 20% of portfolio in any single stock position
- Maximum 30% of portfolio in any single ETF position
- Stop-loss orders set at maximum 10% below entry for individual stocks
- Portfolio-level circuit breakers (pause trading if overall portfolio drops >5% in a week)
- Fractional shares used to properly size positions within budget

### Risk Management Protocols

- Profit-taking targets defined for each strategy
- Weekly review of all positions and strategy performance
- Tax-loss harvesting protocols
- Position sizes scaled according to volatility (more volatile assets get smaller positions)

## Performance Tracking

The system tracks comprehensive metrics to evaluate strategy performance:

### Key Performance Metrics

- **Win Rate**: Percentage of profitable trades
- **Profit Factor**: Gross profits divided by gross losses
- **Maximum Drawdown**: Largest peak-to-trough decline
- **Sharpe Ratio**: Risk-adjusted returns
- **Tax Efficiency**: Long-term vs short-term capital gains ratio

### Database Tracking

- **Trades Table**: Complete transaction history with entry/exit prices, dates, P&L
- **Trade Signals Table**: Technical indicators at time of signal generation
- **Strategy Performance**: Win/loss ratios, average holding periods, profit factors by strategy
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Asset allocation over time, cumulative returns, sector exposure
